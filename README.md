# Transport Project
## Getting Started
Transport Project is a simple project which is developed using React. I made use of functional Components in React for this project. 
<br/>
There are 6 functional Components in this project.
* Heading Component -  Used for creating heading in the project.
* SubHeading- which consists of name of the checkbox and the checkbox.
* Select - used for creating the option field so that we can reuse these field in SelectItem Component
* SelectItem- It consists of title with select and option block
* Vehicle- Its just a simple html5 table.
* Transport- Its the main or parent Component. Here we need to call all the other components and pass the value on it . 
## How to run the code
There are two ways to run any code.
* By going to your folder and clicking the html file.
* Running through Server!!!
## Running React program through server
* install live-server by writing command as
<br/> 
npm i live-server -g
<br/>
(g stands for globally i.e. it is going to be installed globally)
* go to your react folder in command prompt.In my case my folder name is react.So i will simply write command as
<br/> 
cd react.
* once you are in your folder write command as 
<br/>
live-server 
<br/>
It will automatically run index.html file

### Benefits of using live-server
* Every time you save your program you dont need to run the server again and again.
<br/>
It will automatically run the program with the changes.
